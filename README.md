# Facebook story mini

Aim of this project is to create a mini version of Facebook story
using FabricJS and ReactJS

## In this project we will:
Build a simple version of facebook story with 2 types: text story and image story. 
### Text story:
Only input text and choose the background
### Image story: 
Insert image using image url (which actually should be uploaded from local, but to make it simpler, I changed to use link instead)
we also can add multi text as well as change size, position of texts and image.
